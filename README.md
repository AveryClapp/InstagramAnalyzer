# InstagramAnalyzer
This is the Instagram Analyzer application I built to gauge follower and following counts among other stats that are relevant to growing an Instagram account. If you look at the code you may notice that there is little to no API accessing going on, that is because Instagram API doesn't actually allow you to pull followers and following data, which is intersing. Instead, we have to do it manually.
## Steps
While this application is not fully developed, it still has functionality to log into your account, and get your follower accout. As more features come out I will keep this updated but until then here is a list of things that I am working on 

# TODO:
- [ ] Store Followers in local DB
- [ ] Scrape and Store followers
- [ ] Add cross referencing to check for 'ghost followers'
- [ ] Validate Data Vis
